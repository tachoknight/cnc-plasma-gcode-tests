# CNC Plasma Coupon Generator
These programs generate gcode for creating coupons on the [PS1 CNC Plasma machine](https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/CNC_Plasma_Cutter) for troubleshooting both cut quality and gcode generation from both SheetCam and Fusion360. 

Use at your own risk, a couple of M commands (M666 and M667) are Mach 3 macros to turn the torch height controller off and on and may not be present in your setup.
